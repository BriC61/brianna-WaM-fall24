        <h2>A Handmade Web (cont)</h2>
        <p>
            In October 2014 the online journal GIZMODO published an article heralding <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-great-web-1-0-revival-1651487835">The Great Web 1.0 Revival</a>. Its author Kyle Chayka observed:
            <!-- style blockquote --> &ldquo;The booming size of today&rsquo;s mainstream social networks and the constant level of noise we have to deal with has inspired a sudden return to a time when the internet was quieter, safer, and more intimate... We're nostalgic for the close-knit, DIY nature of the early web, where everything was smaller...&rdquo;<br><br>

            The DIY aesthetics and practices of the mid-1990s have been embraced by the anti-social network <a href="https://tilde.club/">TILDE.CLUB</a>, which hosts a small community of users on a single unix computer. For some, TILDE.CLUB serves as a platform for revisiting amateur web aesthetics in a contemporary context. For example, on her page, Olia Lialina invites users to view a new net art work <a href="https://tilde.club/~olialia/">640x480</a> - a 4-tab browser installation. For many others however, TILDE.CLUB has served as little more than a hip territory to occupy. Many pages remain blank.<br><br>

            In other corners of the internet, Web 1.0 aesthetics have never disappeared. <a href="https://luckysoap.com/">My own website</a>, including this page, which uses fixed-width table cells, is based on a template I created in HomeSite in 1997.<br><br>
            
            Web 1.0 aesthetics persist in source code and stated objectives of the massive <a href="https://www.ubuweb.com/">Ubu Web</a> site, an &ldquo;independent resource dedicated to all strains of the avant-garde, ethnopoetics, and outsider arts.&rdquo; On 16 December 2014, the founder of <a href="https://x.com/ubuweb/status/545074372093165568">boasted on Twitter</a> that &ldquo;the whole damn site is still hand-coded in html 1.0 in bbedit, from templates made in 1996.&rdquo;<br><br>
            
            I shall put off updating my website templates until out-of-date design is no longer cool.<br><br>
            
            <!-- style separately --><b>I evoke the term &ldquo;handmade web&rdquo; in order to draw attention both to the manual labour involved in the composition of web pages, and the functioning of the web page itself as a &ldquo;manual,&rdquo; a &ldquo;handbook,&rdquo; a set of instructions required for a computer program to run.</b><br><br>
            
            For most of its history web pages have been read on desktop or laptop computers. Readers have had the option of right-clicking on any page, selecting View Page Source, copying, pasting, and re-writing the source code. In this manner, readers become writers.<br><br>
            
            In February 2015, Matthew Rothberg created a website called <a href="https://github.com/mroth/unindexed">Unindexed</a> which continuously searched Google for itself. It survived for 22 days before being indexed, at which point it was permanently deleted. Rothberg has since shared the source code on GitHub, so you too can create a website which self-destructs the moment Google indexes it.<br><br>
            
            Dozens of readers have re-written the source code of Nick Montfort&rsquo;s <a href="https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/">Taroko Gorge</a> (2008). For many, this was their first experience &ldquo;making&rdquo; a computer-generated text.<br><br>
            
            I have rewritten <a href="https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/">Taroko Gorge</a> three times. Further to the close relation between the handmade web and ephemeral print materials, excerpts of output and source code from the first iteration, <a href="https://luckysoap.com/generations/gorge.html">Gorge</a>(2010), were published in my very small press print book <a href="https://luckysoap.com/generations/generations.html">GENERATION[S]</a> (2010), which, I believe, is now only available as a PDF. Gorge is a never-ending tract of computer-generated text spewing verse approximations, poetic paroxysms on food, consumption, decadence, and desire.<br><br>
            
            <!-- style separately --><b>I evoke the term &ldquo;handmade web&rdquo; in order to draw attention to the physical body.</b><br><br>
            
            Consider the manual labour carried out by the mouse hand in Daniel Eatock&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.onemilescroll.com/">The One Mile Scroll</a>(2008). A few entries appear at the top of the screen - Denver, The Mile High City - my grandfather&rsquo;s grave, Denver - after that we scroll and scroll. The hand is made to work. Through the labour of the body the virtual space of the browser window is transformed into an actual, physical distance.<br><br>
            
            Ironically, handheld devices have distanced us from the handmade web. In <a href="https://theliteraryplatform.com/news/2014/08/from-the-digital-to-the-bookbound/">Reading Writing Interfaces: From the Digital to the Bookbound</a> (2014), Lori Emerson argues: &ldquo;The iPad works because users can&rsquo;t know how it works&rdquo; (15). Reading the web on an iPhone, iPad, or similar device, readers do not have the option of viewing the page source. The iPad provides consumers with access to materials created by others, but cannot easily be used as a tool in the handcrafting of new materials.<br><br>
            
            <!-- style separately --><b>I evoke the term &ldquo;handmade web&rdquo; to suggest slowness and smallness as a forms of resistance.</b><br><br>
            
            In today&rsquo;s highly commercialised web of multinational corporations, proprietary applications, read-only devices, search algorithms, Content Management Systems, WYSIWYG editors, and digital publishers it becomes an increasingly radical act to hand-code and self-publish experimental web art and writing projects.<br><br>
            
            The more proprietary, predatory, and puerile a place the web becomes, the more committed I am to using it in poetic and intransigent ways.<br><br><br>
